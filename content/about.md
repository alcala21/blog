Hi, I'm Carlos F. Alcalá, a Data Scientist from Tampico, México. I specialize in the development and application of Data Science and Machine Learning methods to the monitoring and automation of industrial and technological processes. I have a PhD from the University of Southern California (USC), a Master's degree from The University of Texas at Austin, and a Bachelors degree from the Instituto Tecnológico de Ciudad Madero. Due to my academic background, professional experience and continous development, I have developed a unique profile. I consider myself  a mix of a data scientist, controls engineer and computer engineer, with a passion for helping, learning, playing guitar, dancing, and photography.
